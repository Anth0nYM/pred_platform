Sheep and goat farming refers to the raising of sheep and goats for the production of meat, wool, leather, milk, and other derivatives. In Brazil, this activity is constantly growing.

Sheep and goat farming plays an important role in agribusiness, especially by generating employment opportunities, income, and helping to keep people in rural areas. However, the sector still faces challenges in terms of productivity, management, and coordination among the various links in the meat and leather production chain, which hinders sustainability, competitiveness, and remuneration for producers.

It is in this context that computerized systems and machine learning emerge. An automated weight capture and prediction system can be extremely beneficial, enhancing the productivity of livestock breeders.

The present software aims to develop a prediction module, the capture module. This software is designed to capture and send videos of animals to an API, which will perform preprocessing and subsequently predict the weight of the animals.
